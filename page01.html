    The Universe represented as multiple disk-shaped slices across time, which passes from left to right
    Science (from the Latin word scientia, meaning "knowled
    ge")[1] is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[2][3][4]
    
    The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[5][6] Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide 
    explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes</p></div>
